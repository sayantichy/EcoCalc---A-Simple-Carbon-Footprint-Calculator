## 📊 Example Calculation

**Scenario**:
- Car Travel: 30 km/day  
- Public Transport: 10 km/day  
- Electricity: 5 kWh/day (50% renewable)  
- Diet: Omnivore  
- Waste: 1 kg/day  

**Result**:
- **Total Carbon Footprint**: ~40.8 kg CO₂/day  
- **Suggestions**: Use public transport more often, reduce meat consumption, and switch to renewable energy sources.
